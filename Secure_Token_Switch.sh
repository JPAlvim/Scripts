## Get the desired user's password

NewuserPass="$(/usr/bin/osascript -e 'Tell current application to display dialog "Please enter the password for the desired user:" default answer "" with title "Window Title" with text buttons {"Ok"} default button 1 with hidden answer' -e 'text returned of result')"


## Sets new user with a secure token so it can be enabled for FV2. This requires GUI authentication from the local account but can be run from any account as if secure token admin credentials are entered
## Switch between -secureTokenOn(Off) as needed.
sudo sysadminctl -secureTokenOff $Newuser -password $NewuserPass -adminUser admin -adminPassword admin
